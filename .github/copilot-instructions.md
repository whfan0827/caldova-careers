# Caldova Careers Development Guidelines

This repository contains **Caldova Careers**, an Astro 7 careers board for a fictional AI-native pharmaceutical company. It is the sample app for a **GitHub Copilot CLI** workshop.

## Architecture overview

- Astro 7 uses `output: 'static'` for a mostly prerendered site.
- The only on-demand route is `src/pages/api/apply.ts`, which exports `prerender = false` and exists to write job applications.
- The `@astrojs/node` adapter is present only so `/api/apply` can run on the built Node server.
- Tailwind CSS v4 is wired through `@tailwindcss/vite` with global styles in `src/styles/global.css`.
- Job postings are Astro Content Collection Markdown files in `src/content/jobs/*.md`; they are not database rows.
- The only relational data is the anonymous `applications` table managed with Drizzle ORM and libSQL/SQLite.

## Data layer

Job postings live in the `jobs` content collection defined in `src/content.config.ts` with `import { z } from 'astro/zod'`. Each job file has frontmatter for `title`, `department`, `location`, `type`, `remote`, `postedDate`, and `summary`; the content entry `id` is the filename slug used in role URLs.

Applications live in `db/schema.ts` as the single `applications` table. The `jobId` column is a text logical reference to a content collection entry id and is validated at insert time, not enforced as a database foreign key. Keep application validation in `src/lib/applications.ts` and inject the database into helpers so tests can use `createTestDatabase()`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not add jobs to the database or create seed data. Jobs are content files; applications are the only database-backed feature.

## Astro conventions

Use `getCollection('jobs')` in pages, map entries to plain `Job` objects, and pass those arrays into pure helpers in `src/lib/jobs.ts`. Dynamic role pages live at `src/pages/roles/[slug].astro` and should prerender with `getStaticPaths()` from collection entry ids. Render Markdown bodies with `const { Content } = await render(entry)`.

## Code standards

- Use TypeScript with explicit parameter and return types on every exported function.
- Prefer small, pure, single-purpose helpers in `src/lib/` that operate on plain arrays and are easy to unit-test.
- Keep imports at the top of the file and use consistent 2-space indentation.
- Name functions and variables descriptively; avoid abbreviations.

## Styling and accessibility

Use the dark slate Caldova theme with Navy `#16234B`, Royal `#2E6CFC`, and Ice `#F4F7FC`. Keep reusable UI in `src/components/`, prefer native HTML first, add visible focus states, and use `data-testid` on interactive or workflow-critical elements.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start the Astro dev server; `predev` runs `db:setup` first.
- `npm run build` — build the static site plus Node server entry; `prebuild` runs `db:setup` first.
- `npm run preview` — preview the build when needed.
- `npm run start` — run `node ./dist/server/entry.mjs` for the built Node server.
- `npm run db:generate` — generate Drizzle migrations.
- `npm run db:migrate` — run `tsx db/migrate.ts`.
- `npm run db:setup` — migrate only; there is no seed step.
- `npm run test:unit` — run Vitest.
- `npm run test:e2e` — run Playwright against the built Node server.
- `npm run test:e2e:install` — install Chromium for Playwright.
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint.
- `npm run typecheck` — run `astro check`; this is the only typecheck script.

## Repository structure

- `src/content/jobs/` — Markdown job postings.
- `src/content.config.ts` — the `jobs` collection schema.
- `src/types/job.ts` — the plain `Job` interface used by helpers and UI.
- `src/lib/jobs.ts` — pure helpers over `Job[]` arrays.
- `src/lib/applications.ts` — standalone Zod validation and application insert helper.
- `src/lib/db.ts` — database client creation.
- `src/components/` — `Header`, `RoleCard`, `Tag`, `EmptyState`, and `ApplyForm` components.
- `src/layouts/Layout.astro` — shared page shell.
- `src/pages/` — listing, detail, apply endpoint, thanks, about, and 404 routes.
- `db/` — Drizzle schema, migrations, migration runner, and test helpers.
- `e2e-tests/` — Playwright specs.

## Quality checks

Run tests, linting, and type checking through the `.github/skills/quality-checks` skill guidance. Prefer targeted checks while working, then run the relevant full command before handing off.

## Agent notes

Make precise changes that preserve the workshop's teaching goals. Keep helpers small and unit-testable, avoid adding application features outside the requested issue, and do not introduce scripts, tools, or data sources that are not already in `package.json`.

## Commit hygiene

Use conventional commit prefixes when practical and include this trailer in commits:
