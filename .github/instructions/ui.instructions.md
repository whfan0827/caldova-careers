# Caldova Careers UI strategy

Use this guidance when creating or changing components, pages, and user flows in Caldova Careers.

## Design consistency

Keep the interface professional, calm, and career-focused. Use the dark slate Caldova theme with Royal blue accents for primary actions and important state. Prefer reusable components over one-off page markup.

## Reusability

Put shared UI in `src/components/`. Role cards, tags, empty states, headers, and form controls should accept data through props and avoid fetching data themselves.

## Accessibility

Use native HTML first: links for navigation, buttons for actions, labels for inputs, and headings that describe page structure. Ensure focus states are visible and validation messages are connected to the relevant fields.

## Testability

Add stable `data-testid` attributes to repeated or workflow-critical elements. Good examples include `role-card`, `role-detail`, `apply-form`, `apply-submit`, `role-search`, `role-sort`, `department-filter`, and `pagination-next`.

## Role examples

Role cards should communicate title, department, location, employment type, remote status, and summary without requiring hover. Apply forms should be simple and clear about which fields are required (name and email) versus optional.
